		<h1>Your grid</h1>
		Keep your grid below in a safe, secure place. Remember, if anyone has access to your grid they can work out what your passwords are!

			Scan the QR code below using "Off the Grid" to get the above grid back in to your phone app.

			<h1>Phase 1</h1>
			This will give you your starting position.
			
			<h2>Directions</h2>
			Right > Down > Right > Up > (repeat)
			
			<h2>Strategy</h2>
			Start at column 1, row 1.
			Scan in the current direction until you reach the next letter in sequence. Once you reach the letter, change to the next direction and seek the next letter.
			
			<h2>Example</h2>
			Using the example "amazon"
			<pre>
			Scan 	<strong>right</strong> 	to 	<strong>A</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>down</strong> 	to 	<strong>M</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>right</strong> 	to 	<strong>A</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>up</strong> 	to 	<strong>Z</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>right</strong> 	to 	<strong>O</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>down</strong> 	to 	<strong>N</strong>
			</pre>
		</div>
		
		<div style="page-break-before: always;">
			
			<h1>Phase 2</h1>
			This will allow you to retrieve your password (following phase 1)
			
			<h2>Directions</h2>
			Left > Up > Left > Down > Right > Down > (repeat)
			
			<h2>Strategy</h2>
			Scan in the current direction until you reach the next letter in sequence. Once you reach the letter, "overshoot" by two characters and write those characters down.
			From the position you end up in, change to the next direction and seek the next character in squence.
			<br /><br />
			Once you have found each of the sets of two characters, combine them in to one long string to get your password!
			
			<h2>What if?</h2>
			<strong>If the last character of  "overshoot" characters happens to be the next character you are seeking</strong>, simply move one further square in the direction you are currently moving before switching direction and seeking the next character.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>If you are seeking in a direction and you reach the end of the grid</strong>, just wrap around and continue in the same direction from the other end of the grid.
			
			<h2>Example</h2>
			Using the example "amazon"
			<pre>
			Scan 	<strong>left</strong> 	to	<strong>A</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>Fe</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>up</strong> 	to	<strong>M</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>vf</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>left</strong> 	to	<strong>A</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>Gw</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>down</strong> 	to	<strong>Z</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>zO</strong>
			<strong>*Note: we finish on O, so move down one more row before seeking right to O</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>right</strong> 	to	<strong>O</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>QG</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>down</strong> 	to	<strong>N</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>kP</strong>
			</pre>
			
			Combined in to one long string: FevfGwzOQGkP
		</div>
		
		<div style="page-break-before: always;">
			<h1>Extras</h1>
			
			<h2>Padding</h2>
			If you have used the extra option for padding, during phase 2, in addition to the two characters you write down, you should also write down the non-alphabetic character that appears in the outer border of the grid (by continuing in the same direction)
			
			<h2>Example</h2>
			Using the example "amazon"
			<pre>
			Scan 	<strong>left</strong> 	to	<strong>A</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>Fe</strong>	and outer character	<strong>]</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>up</strong> 	to	<strong>M</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>vf</strong>	and outer character	<strong>4</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>left</strong> 	to	<strong>A</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>Gw</strong>	and outer character	<strong>8</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>down</strong> 	to	<strong>Z</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>nG</strong>	and outer character	<strong>+</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>right</strong> 	to	<strong>O</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>QZ</strong>	and outer character	<strong>2</strong>
			Scan 	<strong>down</strong> 	to	<strong>N</strong>	take next two characters (e.g.) <strong>kP</strong>	and outer character	<strong>;</strong>
			</pre>
			
			Combined in to one long string: FevfGwnGQZkP]48+2;
			
			<h2>Starting position</h2>
			If you choose a different starting position; when beginning phase 1, instead of starting at the first row in colum 1, start at row {x} in column 1. Continue as normal from this position
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h2>Notes on grid capture</h2>
			Add anything additional before printing out your grid (and instructions). For example, what are you using to generate the password? If it's for a website, are you using
			"google" or "google.com" - they will generate different passwords, so jot down any additional notes that will help you remember here. It may help to write what your password for "test.com"/"test" is in the box below (and check it against the app).
